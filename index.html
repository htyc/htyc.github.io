            <p>
    It is our great pleasure to publish this anthology on behalf of 2015 HTYC graduates. This collection aims to recognize our overall progress and effort in
    English. We also dedicate this collection to our schoolmates so that they can appreciate and learn from the variety and quality of our writing experiences.
    .
</p>
<p>
    For many students, writing can be a nightmare in examinations. Within a limited time, we are required to produce pieces that demonstrate comprehensive and
    well-organized content, as well as an excellent grasp of grammatical accuracy and variety. Yet, it is undeniable that writing is indispensable in our
    lives, be it in examinations, the workplace or in daily interactions. This is why we have titled this book ‘Inkastructure’, a portmanteau of ‘ink’ and
    ‘infrastructure’. Writing is indeed a crucial ‘infrastructure’ in life, and is built up with ‘ink’. We write to express our ideas and feelings, to describe
    and share wonderful encounters, or to persuade an audience with a sound argument.
</p>
<p>
    Building this ‘Inkastructure’ is not easy, but thanks to our dedicated English teachers, Ms Ip, Mr Lai and Ms Lum, we have learned to write with greater
    confidence, logic and effect. Over these three years, we read the newspaper extensively to broaden our horizons and enrich our writing content. Reading
    also enhanced our vocabulary
</p>
<p>
    and general expression. Every piece in this anthology was written during our graduation examination so they are authentic and, perhaps, not flawless.
    Still, they
</p>
<p>
    mark a significant milestone in our writing and is the final product of our three-year reading and writing experience.
</p>
<p>
    We hope that after reading our anthology, HTYC students would not fear writing or see it as merely completing a task or meeting a required number of words.
</p>
<p>
    Writing is rewarding and great fun, just grasp your pen and use the ink to build up your unique ‘Inkastructure’! Do it, enjoy it!
